  # Checking if a new version was released at all before starting the matrix would be more efficient, but depends on device
  # So run the whole matrix as cron. One of the first checks is if there is a need for release at all.

      # When run concurrently, 422 might occur on new releases.
      # To completely avoid those, a retry mechanisms would be necessary.
      # It might be easier to build a loop into the bash script.
      # For now, make the action run sequentially
